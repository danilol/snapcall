[ ] One bit of information telling whether your client would be considered a presenter or participant
If "presenter", receives the configuration for screensharing:
 - "VNC Screen Sharing" - "VNC"
 - "WebRTC Screen Sharing" - "WebRTC".

[ ] - The order these technologies are placed in the list defines the priority, i.e.
if VNC is specified first, then your client should try to start VNC
and use WebRTC only in case of failure (fallback).

[ ] - If presenter, there is a "Start" button that must be displayed in the UI.

[ ] - Clicking "Start" button in presenter's mode, sends a special command specifying the sharing technology
The server will reply with either an acknowledgement
(which means that your screen sharing is connected to the server and the server will relay screen updates to the viewers)
or an error; a fallback should be tried in case of error, otherwise the error is displayed in the UI.

[ ] - If VNC and the transmission starts successfully, the server tells whether the updates are sent from the mobile
or desktop operating system
(hereinafter referred as "mobile flag").

Started:
[ ] - "Start" button becomes a "Stop" button, pressing it should trigger a stop command sent to the server (assume it never fails).

1) VNC and mobileFlag == false
the server will regularly send messages to your client informing about the list of the available windows and screens.
[ ] - 2 buttons in the UI: "Select Screen" and "Select Window", clicking will open a pop up window with 2 tabs
("Screns" or "Windows").
If user clicks on "Select Screen", then active tab will be set to "Screens" (the same applies for "Windows").

[ ] - according to selection window or screen, client informs the server about decision.
[ ] - Display the name of selection on "selection name"
[ ] - User can still click "Select Screen" or "Select Window" buttons to change the transmitted entity.

[ ] - Additionally there is a "pause" button on top of the canvas, which can temporarily pause the transmission,
until the user presses on it again (resumes transmission).
Clicking on this button should also produce a message sent to the server, informing it that we want to pause/resume the
transmission (we can assume that this command never fails as well).

2) VNC and mobileFlag == true
[ ] - transmission begins immediately and there are no "Select Window" or "Select Screen" buttons.
[ ] - pause button is still present.
[ ] - selection name = "Mobile Display"


3) WebTRC
[ ] - only one "Select Screen" button is shown, pressing it also triggers a pop up where the user can select a screen,
but in this case no additional information should be sent to the server,
just assume that after selecting this screen, the transmission starts automatically (browser logic).
[ ] - pause button

[ ] - There is a canvas in the middle of the screen which shows a preview of the content which participants will see. The canvas is only displayed
when something is being transmitted.
